# SimpleCalculator

This is a simple calculator CLI app that I developed using Java. As I learn more Java, I plan on returning to this project and adding features.

##Features

* Can do the four basic operations (+, -, *, /)
* Can start calculation over if needed
* Can loop for multiple calculations


###Upcoming Features:

* Error Catching
* More Operations
* GUI
